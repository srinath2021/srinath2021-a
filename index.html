           Prasanth goes to Chitra's house for a matchmaking event. He is a guy who completes his BTech by clearing many

           her dreams of going to Australia. However, her father shows no interest, as she is a girl. When both of them meet at the matchmaking 
           event her younger cousin, Subhash, accidentally locks the door which jams very often and they get stuck eventually. To pass time, they talk about their past.

           to talk with his father about their love and business. Meanwhile, Chitra started her plan eagerly, and was ready to surprise Vikram by buying the truck.
           Then things went wrong and Vikram did not come back overpowered by greed of getting dowry. Chitra and her father waited for him but when they realised Vikram
           wasn't coming back, her father decided to get her married to someone else.

On his turn, Prasanth reveals that he was unemployed and always went out with his two friends. He, along with his friends, made cooking videos, 
as he is passionate about cooking. But it wasn't profitable enough so, they plan to make prank videos and were caught red-handed by Prashant's father, which ended 
their plan. He then got a job in a call centre after he was recommended by his father. He started going out with a girl to show off to his friends, but she cheated on him.
He found out about it only when her second boyfriend called him at work, and quit his job after having a fight with his boss.

It is then revealed that Prasanth came to the wrong address for his matchmaking event. Later, Prasanth goes to his actual matchmaking event, which was with a 
rich family. Meanwhile, Chitra tells the guy coming to her matchmaking event that she's not interested in marriage. The family of Prasanth's bride wanted him to be able to run a 
business, so he and Chitra decide to operate the food truck themselves, with Prasanth as the chef, and Chitra in charge of the business side of things. At first, they face many difficulties, 
mainly through Prasanth's and his friends' laziness as well as fighting with Chitra and giving up the food truck.

Prasanth visits Chitra's house and informs her father that he should be proud to have such a responsible daughter. He also claims that if he ever gets a child he would wish
to have daughter like Chitra and insists him that he let her pursue her dreams. Chitra understands the good nature of Prasanth and later convinces his father that he is a natural 
cook by cooking them Prasanth's recipe. They kickstart their business with the support from both their parents. After this, their food truck becomes a smashing success. In the process,
they fall in love without realizing it, but both of them are engaged to other people, so they drift apart. After realizing they love each other, they come back together through a radio
show organised by their friend, with the support of their family and friends.
